# Multiple Linear Regression

Multiple Linear Regression is a statistical technique used in machine learning for modeling the relationship between multiple independent variables (features) and a single dependent variable (target).

## Overview

In multiple linear regression, the goal is to estimate the parameters (coefficients) of a linear equation that best fits the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable.

The equation of a multiple linear regression model is given by:

Y = β0 + β1X₁ + β2X₂ + ... + βn\*Xn + ε

- Y: Dependent variable (target)
- X₁, X₂, ..., Xn: Independent variables (features)
- β0: Intercept term
- β1, β2, ..., βn: Coefficients (parameters) for each feature
- ε: Error term

The model aims to minimize the sum of squared differences between the observed and predicted values.

## Training Process

1. **Data Collection**: Gather a dataset containing observations of the independent variables and the dependent variable.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, scale features, encode categorical variables, and split the dataset into training and test sets.

3. **Model Training**: Fit a multiple linear regression model to the training data.

4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using appropriate metrics.

## Usage

Multiple Linear Regression can be implemented using various programming libraries, such as scikit-learn in Python.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np

# Sample data
X = np.array([[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]])  # Independent variables
y = np.array([2, 4, 5])  # Dependent variable

# Create and fit the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# Predict
X_new = np.array([[4, 5]])  # New data
prediction = model.predict(X_new)
print("Predicted value:", prediction)
```

## Conclusion

Multiple Linear Regression is a versatile technique for modeling the relationship between multiple independent variables and a single dependent variable. It provides insights into feature importance and can be applied to various regression tasks.
