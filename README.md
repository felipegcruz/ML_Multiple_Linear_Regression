# Multiple Linear Regression

Multiple Linear Regression is a statistical technique used in machine learning for modeling the relationship between multiple independent variables (features) and a single dependent variable (target).

## Overview

In multiple linear regression, the goal is to estimate the parameters (coefficients) of a linear equation that best fits the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable. The equation of a multiple linear regression model is given by:

Y = β0 + β1X₁ + β2X₂ + ... + βn\*Xn + ε


where:
- Y is the dependent variable (target),
- X₁, X₂, ..., Xn are the independent variables (features),
- β0 is the intercept term,
- β1, β2, ..., βn are the coefficients (parameters) corresponding to each feature,
- ε is the error term representing the difference between the observed and predicted values.

The multiple linear regression model aims to minimize the sum of squared differences between the observed and predicted values, similar to simple linear regression.

## Training Process

The training process in multiple linear regression involves the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather a dataset containing observations of the independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (target).

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Perform any necessary preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values, scaling features, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the dataset into training and test sets.

3. **Model Training**: Fit a multiple linear regression model to the training data by estimating the coefficients (parameters) that minimize the sum of squared errors between the observed and predicted values.

4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using appropriate metrics, such as mean squared error (MSE), R-squared (coefficient of determination), or adjusted R-squared.

## Usage

Multiple Linear Regression can be implemented using various programming libraries, such as scikit-learn in Python. Here's a basic example of how to use Multiple Linear Regression with scikit-learn:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import numpy as np

# Sample data
X = np.array([[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]])  # Independent variables (features)
y = np.array([2, 4, 5])  # Dependent variable (target)

# Create and fit the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# Get coefficients and intercept
coefficients = model.coef_
intercept = model.intercept_

# Predict
X_new = np.array([[4, 5]])  # New data
prediction = model.predict(X_new)
print("Predicted value:", prediction)

## Conclusion
Multiple Linear Regression is a versatile and widely used technique for modeling the relationship between multiple independent variables and a single dependent variable. It provides insights into the impact of each feature on the target variable and can be applied to various regression tasks in different domains.
